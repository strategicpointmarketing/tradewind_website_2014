								<p class="petite-text mtxs">The purpose of the panoramic window is to consider the cut-out made in a façade as a direct link between solid spaces and voids, to allow an objective interactivity between interior and exterior that fulfils the premise so dear to both the Modernist and Minimalist movements; namely, the desire to frame Nature without manipulating it or disturbing the perception of it.</p>

				<h3 class="secondary-heading paragon-text capitalize mtxs">The Minimal Frame Window - Nature Uninhibited.</h3>
				
				<p>According to Le Corbusier, the panoramic window  introduces “the vastness of the outside world, the unity, impossible to counterfeit, of a landscape with
tempest and radiant calm”. While traditional window systems use glass as a filler and the frame as a structural support, we work with the intrinsic characteristic
of glass and give it the function of a self-supporting element, free to slide within a frame with no constraints regarding its dimensions.</p>

				<p>Thus the panoramic window takes on its full significance, detaching itself from dimensional constraints and henceforth only measuring itself against the static limitations of the glass itself.
