				<p>Our minimal frame system makes the impossible possible defying the laws of physics.  Deeply rooted in engineering and with unique technology that makes the product possible. With a vast array of options never seen before in the USA, Trade Wind with Panoramah is creating a new definition to minimal frame context.   Options range from panels 16 foot wide by 8 foot tall with a door that creates a post less  than 90 degree from the corner.  This attached to another sliding door that is 38 feet wide 3 panel.  Simply press a button and everything automatically opens so your inside is now outside. </p>

				<p>Also available in this unique system are vertical sliders and pivot doors. With the vertical slider you have the same visual components of the sliding door but now you can create open spaces that raise up instead of sliding to the side.  With this option you can have a window 30 feet wide by 10 feet tall raise into the air and be able to walk under or have it disappear into the floor. You can chose the pivot system that can allow for large door sash sizes that pivot effortlessly and create a very dramatic effect. </p>

							<p>This series of sliding units combines two elements that typically don't go together - minimal site lines and very large venting units. This product features industry-leading sizes larger than what most people think is possible with only small slivers of visible aluminum.  With a wide ranges of configurations, colors, finishes, materials, and glazing, architectural design freedom is at its best.  Take the time to learn more about the possibilities and you will see how this product can take your project to a whole new level. Imagine pushing a button and a 60-foot-wide three-panel door disappears - a wall of glass that is no more. </p>

						<p>Why limit the grandness of an entryway by restricting how much a hinge can handle? Expand the view and take advantage of a much larger sized panel that pivots on two anchor points in the sill.  Walk up to what appears as a wall of glass and be able to vent it with ease. This is a very clean look, reducing the amount of visible frames that would be necessary with more conventional doors systems.</p>

							<p>This series has a unique functionality where the sashes slide up and down instead of left and right with very minimal horizontal mullions between venting sashes.  The window can drop into the floor so all viable glass will disappear. This product is great for areas where clients want wall-to-wall glass but have the ability to vent all the glass leaving a completely clear opening. Very large sizes can be achieved with this product that can be operated manually or with motorization. </p>
